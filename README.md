# Elections---Project
Elections Project - OOP with C++.
In this Project I created Elections with easy inputs for the user. 
There are 2 types of Elections - simple and Regular (differ by amount of districts and type of districts).
in any step you may: 
add a district / citizen / party / candidateOfParty.
view district list / citizen list of each district / and party lists.
When all the conditions has met, you can start the voting for each party.
After all votes are in - you can see the results.
In addition you can save your current Elections to a file or load an existing one.
